The story takes place in an alternate reality where we have some of the modern tech we have today,
but in which we never moved past the middle ages, as we are still ruled by kings and queens.

You are the youngest of three sons of the king of Pixendia (some where in central to eastern Europe).
The king has fallen ill quite some time ago, and now he is sure that his end is near. He was one of the
most loved kings in his kingdom, unlike your uncle who ruled before him with an iron fist until he went
missing in a great battle.
A king like that is the last thing that your father wants to be the next ruler of Pixendia, so a short time
after he became king, he broke one of his most valued possesions, the sword with which he trained every day
when he was little, and gave a piece to some of his closest friends.
Now it's your time to show that your are the one that deserves the throne the most. But remember, your after
always told you: "The best way to destory an enemy is to make him your friend"

So it begins. The oldest goes in the direction of the Balaton Lake, thing a friend put it at the bottom, the
middle bother seems to be going to the Carpathian Mountions, as maybe the caves may be hiding a piece. Now the
question is WHERE WILL YOU GO :
1. Stay in the city, maybe a friend is still here
2. Go north, a friend of his at whom you spent a lot of time as a kid stays there
Editor note : You will have to take one of these pieces first, as the other will be locked until you get every
other one, so the final boss fight will either be in the main city, or at your dad's friend
